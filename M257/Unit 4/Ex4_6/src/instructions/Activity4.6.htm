<h1>Activity 4.6 - Writing a user-defined exception class</h1>

<h2>Topic</h2>

<p>Here we extend the previous
activity to employ a user-defined exception class.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the Solution
document, the project for this activity contains three classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="PA">Read_a_Sonnet</span>, which you will need to modify; </li>

<li>
<span class="PA">FileFormatException</span>, which is incomplete; 
</li>

<li>
<span class="PA">Main</span>, which contains test code for the
activity.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there is a
text file, <span class="PA">sonnet1.txt</span>, which can be found in the project folder. This contains a well-known
sonnet (a fourteen-line poem) by William Shakespeare.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>The <span class="PA">run</span> method of the class <span class="PA">Read_a_Sonnet</span> will read the first fourteen lines
of the file <span class="PA">sonnet1.txt</span> and will print them out one by one. The <span class="PA">main</span> method should handle any exceptions
of type <span class="PA">IOException</span> that may occur.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Run
the project and check that it displays the fourteen-line poem correctly.
</li>

<li>
Open the class <span class="PA">FileFormatException</span>, and complete the definition of this
user-defined exception class. 
</li>

<li>
In class <span class="PA">Read_a_Sonnet</span>, make appropriate changes so that the relevant methods throw and handle
a <span class="PA">FileFormatException</span>, rather than an <span class="PA">EOFException</span>, if the file does not have enough
lines. 
</li>

<li>
Check that your modified classes work both for a file with at least the required
number of lines (14) and for a shorter file (edit the text file in the IDE). 
</li>
</ol>
