<h1>Discussion of Activity 4.5 - Developing a class that throws exceptions</h1>
<p>Here is our sample solution for the class <span class="PA">Read_a_Sonnet</span>:</p>
<pre>
import java.io.*;
public class Read_a_Sonnet
{
   private FileReader fr;
   private BufferedReader br;
   final static int LINES_IN_SONNET = 14;

   public void run() throws IOException
   {
      openFile("sonnet1.txt");
      try
      {
         readLines(LINES_IN_SONNET);
      }
      catch (EOFException ex)
      {
         System.out.println("Wrong number of lines in poem. " + ex);
      }
      finally
      {
         closeFile();
      }
   }

   // open the specified file
   private void openFile(String fileName) throws IOException
   {
      fr = new FileReader(fileName);
      br = new BufferedReader(fr);
      System.out.println("== File "+ fileName + " opened OK");
      // just for testing
   }

   /* Read and display the specified number of lines from text
      file.
      Modify this method so that it throws an EOFException if the
      file has less lines than required
   */

   private void readLines(int numberOfLines) throws IOException,
      EOFException
   // Note: not strictly necessary to list EOFException here - why?
   {
      String nextLine;
      int lineCount;
      nextLine = br.readLine();
      lineCount = 0;
      while (nextLine != null && lineCount &lt; numberOfLines)
      {
         lineCount++;
         System.out.println(nextLine);
         nextLine = br.readLine();
      }
      if (lineCount &lt; numberOfLines)
      {
         throw new EOFException("read "+ lineCount + " lines");
      }
   }

   // close the text file
   private void closeFile() throws IOException
   {
      br.close();
      fr.close();
      System.out.println("== File closed OK"); // just for testing
   }
}
</pre>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Note that method <span class="PA">readLines</span> has been declared as throwing both <span class="PA">IOException</span> and <span class="PA">EOFException</span>.&nbsp; This is not strictly necessary, since <span class="PA">EOFException</span> is a subclass of <span class="PA">IOException</span>.&nbsp; Therefore we could just declare that the method throws an <span class="PA">IOException</span>, since this implicitly includes all exceptions which are subclasses of <span class="PA">IOException</span>.&nbsp; In this case, we have left both exceptions in the method header, as it advertises more clearly that an <span class="PA">EOFException</span> is possible.</p>
