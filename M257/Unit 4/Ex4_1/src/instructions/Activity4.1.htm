<h1>Activity 4.1 - Reading input from the keyboard</h1>

<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>In this activity, we write a class to read input from the keyboard. </p>

<h2>Materials </h2>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this activity contains
two classes: </p>

<ul>
 <li><span class="PA">Greeter</span>, which is in
     skeleton form; </li>
 <li><span class="PA">Main</span>, which contains test code for the activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task </h2>

<p>The class <span class="PA">Greeter</span> is to have a method <span class="PA">run</span>, containing a loop which repeatedly prompts the user for
their name and prints the message: </p>

<pre>I am very pleased to meet you, X </pre>

<p>where<span class="PA">X</span> stands for the name typed in by the
user. </p>

<p>If the user types <span class="PA">Bye</span> at the prompt the loop should
terminate.</p>

<p>Your run method should make use of a class called <span class="PA">Scanner</span>
which we describe below.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>The project will not compile at this stage, so do not try to run it. </p>

<p>Before Java 5.0 you would read text from the keyboard by using code similar to the
following:</p>

<pre>
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your input&quot;);
String input = br.readLine();
</pre>

<p>Java 5.0 introduced a versatile new class <span class="PA">Scanner</span> which
offers an alternative way of reading keyboard input. Using <span class="PA">Scanner</span>,
the code above can be replaced with the following.</p>

<pre>
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your input&quot;);
String input = sc.nextLine();
</pre>

<p><span class="PA">Scanner</span> also takes care of any exceptions that may occur, so
we do not have to do anything about exception handling.</p>

<p>Open the class <span class="PA">Greeter</span> and add code where indicated. Note
that <span class="PA">Scanner</span> is in the package <span class="PA">java.util</span>
rather than <span class="PA">java.io. Greeter</span> already contains the necessary import statement, 
but note also that it is easy to fix missing import statements in NetBeans by 
right-clicking in a source file and selecting 'Fix Imports'.
</p>

<p>When you have made all the additions, run the project to test what you have written.
When the program is executed an Output window will open at
the bottom of the main NetBeans window.
Enter a name or <span class="PA">Bye</span> in the output window and press Return.
The response will appear in the Output window.</p>
