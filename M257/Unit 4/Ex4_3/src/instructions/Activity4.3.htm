<h1>Activity 4.3 - Writing a date-stamp to a text file</h1>

<h2>Topic</h2>

<p>In this activity, we write
a date-stamp to a text file.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the Solution
document, the project for this activity contains three classes: </p>

<ul>
<li><span class="PA">DateStamp</span>, a utility class we have written,
which has a static method to return today's date in full, e.g. Saturday,
 January 10, 2004.</li>

<li><span class="PA">DateStamper</span>, the <span class="PA">run(String)</span> method of which is to write a
date-stamp to the file specified by the string argument. This class is
incomplete. </li>

<li><span class="PA">Main</span>, which contains test code. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the project
folder contains a text file, <span class="PA">sample2.txt</span>, empty at present, which is to be date-stamped.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>At present the <span class="PA">run</span> method in <span class="PA">DateStamper</span> 
merely obtains a date-stamp and prints an informative message 
via <span class="PA">System.out</span>. 
Nothing is actually written to the file as yet. 
Your task is to supply the code that opens an output stream for
writing to the text file, and writes the date-stamp to the file. </p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Open the file <span class="PA">sample2.txt</span>, using the File|Open File... option from the IDE. It should be empty. Leave the file open.</p>

<p>Open <span class="PA">DateStamper</span> and insert code where indicated. Run the
project. </p>

<p>If your code is correct,
you should see that <span class="PA">sample2.txt</span> has now acquired a date-stamp. </p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>For
simplicity, this application uses only a <span class="PA">FileWriter</span> and a <span class="PA">PrinterWriter</span>, with no <span class="PA">BufferedWriter</span> between them. </li>

<li>If
you edit the <span class="PA">Main</span> class to alter the file name passed to the <span class="PA">run</span> method, and then re-run the
project, you will find that a new file of that name is created and
date-stamped. </li>
</ol>
