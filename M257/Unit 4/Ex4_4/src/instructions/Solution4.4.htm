<H1>Discussion of Activity 4.4 - A program which throws an exception</H1>

<P>Here are the expected results at each stage of this activity: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI>You should find that
	the program halts and reports an <span class="PA">OutOfMemoryError</span>
	exception. This type of exception is not at all common and has only
	come about because we have provoked it deliberately.
	</br></br>
	<LI>The exception should not occur this time, as most
	systems should be able to allocate one million <span class="PA">ints</span>.
	If it does still occur, reduce the amount of memory requested again
	to <span class="PA">1000
	ints</span>. This should work on any reasonable system. The
	program should complete normally and print the message: 
	</br></br>
	<pre>Successfully allocated </pre>
</li>
	<LI>You might think that this would have the same
	effect as the first experiment, after an attempt to allocate a
	million million <span class="PA">ints
	(1000*1000*1000*1000)</span>.
	However, an <span class="PA">int</span>
	variable in Java cannot store a number as big as this, so the
	calculation &quot;wraps around&quot; to a negative value, and you
	should get messages like this: 
	<pre>Try to allocate memory for -727379968 ints
java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException </pre>
	So the program does fail to complete, but with an exception
	indicating an attempt to construct an array whose size is a negative
	number - tricky!</li>
</OL>
