<h1>Activity 4.2 - Reading from a text file</h1>

<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>In this activity, we read lines from a sample text file and print them out
one by one. </p>

<h2>Materials </h2>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this activity contains
two classes: </p>

<ul>
 <li><span class="PA">Read_a_File</span>, which is incomplete; </li>
 <li><span class="PA">Main</span>, which contains test code for the activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition there is a text file <span class="PA">sample1.txt</span> which is
not part of the project but which can be found in the project folder. </p>

<h2>Task </h2>

<p>The <span class="PA">run</span> method of the class <span class="PA">Read_a_File</span> is to read successive lines of the file <span class="PA">sample1.txt</span> and print them out one by one, halting when there
are no more lines. </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>

<p>Do not run the project at this stage, it will not yet compile.</p>

<p>The <span class="PA">Scanner</span> class you were introduced to in Activity
4.1 can be employed to read from any input stream, not just <span class="PA">System.in</span>. </p>

<p>To read from a file, we use the filename to construct a <span class="PA">File</span>
object, then create a <span class="PA">Scanner</span> for the <span class="PA">File</span>
object, like this:</p>

<pre>Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(<i>filename</i>));</pre>

<p>Once the <span class="PA">Scanner</span> is created we can read lines from it
using <span class="PA">nextLine()</span>
just as we did in Activity 4.1.</p>

<p>Open the class <span class="PA">Read_a_File</span>
and complete the code where indicated. </p>

<p>Run the project to read an instructive quote from a computing pioneer.</p>
