<h1>Activity 5.5 - Using an interface</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity explores the use of the <span class="PA">Comparable </span>interface. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project
for this activity contains two classes: </p>
<ul >
  <li><span class="PA">Employee</span>, which is partially implemented; </li>
  <li><span class="PA">EmployeeTest</span>, which will test your code. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>The class <span class="PA">Employee</span> contains personnel details about employees. It has a
constructor and a number of public getter/setter methods. These features of the
class have already been implemented for you. </p>
<p>The class is also required to implement the <span class="PA">Comparable&lt;Employee&gt;</span> interface, which means
that it must provide a <span class="PA">compareTo</span> method with the following header:</p>
<p class="PS">public int compareTo(Employee emp) </p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>
1. Open the source file for class <span class="PA">Employee</span>. Modify the class so that it
implements the <span class="PA">Comparable</span> interface for the correct type,
and write an appropriate <span class="PA">compareTo</span> method,
so that employees can be ranked in order of salary.
</p>
<p>Now run the project and check the output.</p>

<p>
   2. Now implement the <span class="PA">compareTo</span>  method so that employees are sorted
   by their names instead of by their salaries.
