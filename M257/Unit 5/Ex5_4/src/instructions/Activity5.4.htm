<h1>Activity 5.4 - Providing the code for the class <span class="PA">UserComputers</span></h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity uses a hash map to associate the names of users with the names
of the computers they use. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project
for this activity contains two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">UserComputers</span>, which is in skeleton form; </li>
  <li><span class="PA">UserComputersTest</span>, which will test your code. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>The class <span class="PA">UserComputers</span> is to have a one-argument constructor and the
following public methods: </p>
<ul>
<li class = "PA">public void addLink(String userName, String computerName) </li>
<li class = "PA">public String getComputer(String userName) </li>
<li class = "PA">public boolean isThereAUser(String userName) </li>
<li class = "PA">public boolean isThereAComputer(String computerName) </li>
</ul>
<p>The skeleton class provided gives the specifications of these methods in the
form of comments. Your task is to implement the methods, using appropriate
utility methods from the <span class="PA">HashMap</span> class. You will also need to import the
necessary Java package. </p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Open the class <span class="PA">UserComputers</span>. Add an <span class="PA">import</span> statement where shown. Then fill
in the body of the constructor and the four methods, following the
specifications given. </p>

<p>Run the project, and check that the output is as you expected</p>
