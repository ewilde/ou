<h1>Discussion of Activity 10.2 - Programming an applet</h1>

<p>If this applet does not run at all, or behaves oddly, see the discussion for Activity 10.1
which has some suggestions for basic things that might be wrong.  The following comments apply
to the corresponding numbered instructions in the Activity 10.2 document.<p>

<ol>
  <li><p>You may get some odd effects if you made the applet window very large or very small.
  Otherwise this should be fairly straightforward.  If the robot image does not appear, but
  the game otherwise works, check that you have specified the <span class="PA">images</span> folder and the file name
  correctly in the second argument of the <span class="PA">getImage</span> method.</p>


  <li><p>If you changed the size of the applet window in the previous task, things
  may or may not work as you expect when viewing using a browser.  This is because the maximum
  size of the applet window is set by the <span class="PA">APPLET</span> tag in the web page.</p>

  <li><p>To make the class act as a <span class="PA">MouseListener</span>, you need to modify the class header as follows:</p>
  <pre>
  public class SpotTheRobot extends Applet implements MouseListener
  </pre>

  <p>You then need to delete the inner class <span class="PA">MouseTrap</span> and implement the
  five methods of the <span class="PA">MouseListener</span> interface as methods of class <span class="PA">SpotTheRobot</span>:</p>

  <pre>
  public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {}
  public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {}
  public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {}
  public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {}

  public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)
  {
     mouseXPosition = e.getX();
     mouseYPosition = e.getY();
     repaint();  // invokes the applet paint method
  }
  </pre>

<p>As you can see, the four unused methods have empty method bodies and the
   <span class="PA">mouseClicked</span> method is defined in exactly the same way as before.
  </p>

  <p>Finally, you need to change the code in the <span class="PA">init</span> method
  so that the applet itself is the listener, rather than the <span class="PA">MouseTrap</span> object as before.
  To do this, you delete the following line:<p>

  <pre>
     this.addMouseListener(new MouseTrap());
  </pre>
  <p>And replace it with the following code:<p>

  <pre>
     this.addMouseListener(this);
  </pre>

  <p>Making the applet listen for mouse clicks may seem a little odd, but this technique is
  sometimes used and it is useful to be familiar with this idea. As far as the Java
  system is concerned, the listener can be almost anything as long as it
  implements the necessary methods for the <span class="PA">MouseListener</span> interface.
   </li>
</ol>
