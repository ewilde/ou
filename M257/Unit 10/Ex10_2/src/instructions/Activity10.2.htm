<h1>Activity 10.2 - Programming an applet</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This <i>optional</i> exercise allows you to modify or extend the applet for the game "Spot the Robot",
discussed in the course text.</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project
for this exercise contains one Java class: </p>
<ul class="LS">
  <li><span class="PA">SpotTheRobot</span>, which is a complete applet but can be used as a basis for
  further work. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Task </h2>
<p>You are to make a number of changes to the applet and run it using either the
<span class="PA">appletviewer</span> or a browser,
to see how your modified game works in each case. We suggest using the<span class="PA">appletviewer</span>.</p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>  
  <li><p>Experiment with using a different image file by changing the filename parameter
  in the <span class="PA">getImage</span> method invocation
  (look in the <span class="PA">images</span> folder to see what is available). Or try changing
  the size of the applet window by changing the relevant constants in the code. Run the file by right-clicking on it in the Projects window and choosing Run File. This should display the applet using the <span class="PA">appletviewer</span>.</p>

  <p>Close down the applet window to finish.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Modify the applet class, <span class="PA">SpotTheRobot</span>, to act as a mouse listener,
  instead of using the inner class <span class="PA">MouseTrap</span>.  See the course text for
  some initial ideas about how to do this.  As before, run your modified applet and
  check that it still works as expected.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Design a more complex game, using a number of robot images and possibly other images,
  and a screen display that responds to mouse clicks.  Modify the applet class, <span class="PA">SpotTheRobot</span>,
  to implement your game.  For example, you may wish to have robots chasing each other around
  the screen or being "zapped" by the mouse - it is up to you!  Run your modified applet and
  check that it works as expected.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>If you have access to a website, you may wish to try installing
  one or more of your applets together with its associated web page.  You can then try
  downloading and running the web page linked to the applet.  Make sure that any
  image files or audio files required by the applet are downloaded from the computer
  that hosts the website.  Recall that applet security restrictions mean that a
  standard applet cannot access the local file system (i.e. on the computer that
  is running the applet).</p>
</li>
<h2>Note</h2>
  <p>[IMPORTANT]Unless you are very sure of what you are doing, it is not
  a good idea at this stage to make your applet publicly available.  If you
  want to do this, get some expert advice.</p>
  
  <p>
  To set the size of the applet in a browser, after building, 
  copy the HTML file from the build folder 
  to the src/ex10_2 folder and edit the size of the applet in the HTML file 
  by setting the width and height attributes in the APPLET tag.
