<h1>Activity 10.6 - Using low level interfaces</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This exercise allows you to develop a MIDlet with a low level user interface.</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>You will make use of the MIDlets 
<span class="PA">SimpleGraphics</span> and class <span class="PA">MyCanvas</span> described in Unit 10.</p>
<p>The code for <span class="PA">SimpleGraphics</span> and <span class="PA">MyCanvas</span> has
been added to this project as text files for you to amend.
</p>

<h2>Task </h2>
<p>The MIDlet <span class="PA">SimpleGraphics</span> and its associated class
<span class="PA">MyCanvas</span>, produces a simple circle on the screen which the user is able
to move around. In this activity you will modify this MIDlet so that the circle moves continuously
in the chosen direction rather than just one pixel. The circle then continues in this direction until
one of the other arrow keys is selected. The circle will then move continuously in this new direction.</p>
<p>This is the basis of a number of simple computer games and in itself it can be considered a game
with the object being to keep the circle on the screen. Further simple developments would be to add
fixed objects to be avoided (or hit) or even an 'AI' driven opponent! You have already met the idea
of collision detection in Unit 7.</p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
  <li><p>Follow the instructions from Activity 4 to create a new project and a MIDlet called <span class="PA">SimpleGraphics</span>. The package should be named <span class="PA">simplegraphics</span>. You may want to copy the code of the MIDlet and the class <span class="PA">MyCanvas</span> in step 2 below from the text files provided.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Add a class (not a MIDlet) <span class="PA">MyCanvas</span> to the project, making sure it is in the same package as the <span class="PA">SimpleGraphics</span> MIDlet, then compile and run the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Alter the code in <span class="PA">MyCanvas</span> so as to cause the circle to keep moving in the direction which has been selected, until a different direction is pressed. Re-compile and run.</p>
  </li>
