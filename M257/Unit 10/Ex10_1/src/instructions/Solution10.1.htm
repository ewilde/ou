        <h2>Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>You were not asked to make any changes to the program, so it should have just worked OK.
                We hope you had fun playing the game!  The detailed operation of the program is
                discussed in the course unit.</p>
            </li>

            <li><p>The web page should display a line of text above the applet.
                The applet window area may be displayed with a different background colour from the rest of the web page.
                In the previous task you should have seen that the <span class="PA">appletviewer</span> only displays the applet window and
                ignores any other HTML or text in the web page.</p>

                <p>You may possibly have problems if your browser does not support applets,
                but since we have used an applet inheriting from the class <span class="PA">Applet</span>,
                it should work on most browsers.  See the course unit for a discussion of
                browser variations in applet support.</p>

                <p>If you find that the applet functions to some extent, but does not display the robot image,
                please check that the magic robot image file <span class="PA">MagicRobot.jpg</span> is contained in the
                <span class="PA">images</span> subfolder of the src folder for this project (<span class="PA">src</span> is the folder which also contains the subfolders <span class="PA">ex10_1</span> and <span class="PA">instructions</span>).</p>

                <p>If you are sure that your browser supports applets (and most should support this applet)
                but the applet does not run correctly from the browser, 
                make sure that the applet code has been compiled 
                (right-click on the project node <span class="PA">Ex10_1</span> 
                and choose <span class="PA">Clean and Build Project</span>) 
                and that the compiled 
                code <span class="PA">SpotTheRobot.class</span> is stored 
                in the folder <span class="PA">Ex10_1/build/classes/ex10_1</span>. 
                You can see the contents of this folder by navigating to it in the Files window.</p>

                <p>The next activity gives you a chance to modify this applet or write one of your own.</p>
