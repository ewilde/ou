        <h1>Activity 10.1 - Playing 'Spot the Robot'</h1>

        <h2>Topic </h2>
        <p>This exercise allows you to play the game "Spot the Robot", discussed in the course text.</p>

        <h2>Materials </h2>
        <p>In addition to the Solution document, the project
            for this exercise contains one Java class: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="PA">SpotTheRobot_1</span>, which is a complete applet. </li>
        </ul>        

        <h2>Task </h2>
        <p>You are to run the applet using both the <span class="PA">appletviewer</span> and a browser, to see how this simple game works in each case.</p>

        <h2>Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First examine the code and then build the project.</p>

                <p>Next, in the Projects window, open the package <span class="PA">ex10_1</span>.
                    Right-click on the node <span class="PA">SpotTheRobot_1.java</span>
                    and choose Run File.</p>
                <p>Play the game by clicking on the applet window where 
                    you think the robot will next appear.
                    When you have successfully guessed its position,
                    you can click the mouse again to start another game.</p>
                <p>Close down the applet window to finish.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>In the Files window, in the <span class="PA" >build</span> folder, 
                    right-click on the node <span class="PA">SpotTheRobot.html</span>,
                    and select View. (There may be other copies of this html file, so be sure to pick the right one.)
                    This will run the applet in your default browser. It can take a while to start!
                </p>
                You can set the size of the applet by editing the width and height tags in the HTML file.
                Dimensions of about 640 x 480 are better than the defaults.
            </li>

            <p>
                To retain the size of the applet for future runs,
                copy the HTML file from the build folder
                to the src/ex10_1 folder.
            </p>
        </ol>
