<h1>Activity 10.3 - Running a MIDlet example</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>Running demonstration MIDlets on a mobile phone emulator.</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In this Activity you will use the sample MIDlets provided with
NetBeans.</p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
  <li> <br>
  </li>
Before you attempt this activity, you should have installed the
Wireless Toolkit. This should have happened automatically when you
installed the NetBeans Software CD. You can see that the Wireless
Toolkit is installed in NetBeans using the Tools menu and selecting
Java Platform Manager. This should show that you have the Java Micro
Edition SDK 3.0 installed as well as the Java SE JDK 1.6.
  <p>If you have some other Wireless Toolkit installed, such as the Sun
Wireless Toolkit, you may need to</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Remove that platform (click on the platform name and select
Remove). </li>
    <li>Then use Add Platform... and browse to the location of the
Micro Edition Toolkit, for example, under your user home folder, <span
 class="PA">.netbeans</span> installation folder or under <span
 class="PA">C:\Sun\Java_ME_platform_SDK_3.0</span></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <p>In NetBeans select <span class="PA">File|New Project...</span>
and the <span class="PA">New Project</span> wizard will appear. Under <span
 class="PA">Categories</span>: expand <span class="PA">Samples</span>
and then select <span class="PA">Java ME (MIDP)</span>, as shown below.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on <span class="PA">Sun Samples - Demos</span> and then <span
 class="PA">Next&gt;</span>.</p>
    <p>The wizard should now look like this. Make sure that the <span
 class="PA">Project Location</span>: is correct. It should be <span
 class="PA">C:\M257\Unit 10</span> if you have used the same folder
structure as us.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <span class="PA">Finish</span> and the new project will
appear in the Projects window. (You may need to expand it to see the
packages it contains.)</p>
    <p><img src="Activity10.3_files/image004.png"

  </li>
  <li>
    <p> As you see, NetBeans uses a special icon for mobile projects
(highlighted above). Make sure that <span class="PA">SunSamples-Demos1</span>
is set as the main project, then select <span class="PA">Run Main
Project</span>. Compiling the program may take some time, but after a
while you will be presented with an emulation of a mobile phone. </p>
    <img src="Activity10.3_files/image005.png"
 alt="Screengrab of mobile phone emulator" width="366" height="729">
    <p> (You can choose different emulators in the project properties
dialogue. The one above is the DefaultFxPhone1.) This has the same
functionality as if the phone were real (except you cannot make calls
with it of course!) You 'press' buttons by clicking on them with the
mouse pointer. Alternatively you can use your computer keyboard. </p>
    <p> On the screen of the phone a suite of MIDlets is displayed. To
launch a highlighted MIDlet you can</p>    
    <ul>
      <li>press the centre of the multi-directional control <br>
      </li>
      <li>use the soft key for the Menu (at the bottom right-hand side
of the phone screen) to select the word 'Launch', or <br>
      </li>
      <li>press Enter on your keyboard. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  
You can also use the Up, Down, Left and Right arrows instead of the
multi-directional keys to move around the phone's menu.
    <p> The term soft key will be explained further in the Unit, but
essentially it is a key to which a variety of actions can be
associated. The text above the soft key at any given time indicates the
current semantics of pressing the related soft key. </p>
  </li>
    <img src="Activity10.3_files/image006.png"
 alt="the central multi-directional control and soft keys" width="500"
 height="369">
    <li> Highlight the MIDlet called <b>Colors</b> and run it using one of the
available controls.<br>
    <br>
This will launch a MIDlet which allows you to adjust the balance of
colours on a palette and is very similar to the program studied in Unit
7. You can use the multi-directional key to switch colours (up and
down) and to increase or decrease the amount of a particular colour
(left or right).
    <p>By pressing the 'soft key' associated with Exit you can return
to the list of MIDlets and try another. By pressing the off button of
the phone, you can close the emulation and return to the NetBeans.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p> Follow the same steps as those above to try out some other MIDP
samples. Please feel free to investigate whichever MIDlets take your
fancy! </p>
