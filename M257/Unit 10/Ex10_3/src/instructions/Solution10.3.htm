<h1>Discussion of Activity 10.3 - Running a MIDlet example</h1>

<p>It is possible for firewalls or anti-virus software to
    interfere with the running of the emulator.
    If you have firewall problems, check our advice on how to handle
    firewalls in the Unit 9 activities.
<p>If anti-virus software incorrectly identifies the
    emulator as an internet worm and blocks it,
    you may need to customise the anti-virus settings to allow
    the emulator process to run.
