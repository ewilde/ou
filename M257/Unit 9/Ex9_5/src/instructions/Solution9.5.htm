<h1>Discussion of Activity 9.5 - Testing the simple server</h1>

<ol>
<li>

<p>It is important to ensure that the server is running before you try to run
the <span class="PA">telnet</span> client.  The server should display a message
to indicate that it is starting up, and some further messages when the client
connects and when the server closes down.
</p>

<p>There is no special significance in using port 3000 - any port number could have
been used, although it is normally best to avoid numbers in the range 0-1023 some of
which are conventionally used for standard services.  If you omit the port number
from the  <span class="PA">telnet</span> command, then <span class="PA">telnet</span>
defaults to trying port 23, which in this case will not work.</p>

<p>You can experiment with
using other port numbers by editing the <span class="PA">PORT_NUMBER</span>
constant in the class <span class="PA">HelloServer</span>.  You must of course
use the same port number when running the <span class="PA">telnet</span> client.
</p>
</li>

<p>Instead of typing <span class="PA">localhost</span> in the <span class="PA">telnet</span> command, you
can also use the special IP address, <span class="PA">127.0.0.1</span>, the so-called loopback address, that
we met in Activity 9.3.  This is the special IP address which always
refers to the local host computer.
The <span class="PA">telnet</span> program always accepts either symbolic addresses or numerical IP addresses.
