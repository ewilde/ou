<h1>Activity 9.5 - Testing the simple server</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>In this activity we try out the simple server discussed in section 7 of Unit 9.
For a client we use the <span class="PA">telnet</span> program we met in Activity 9.4.
</p>

<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project
for this exercise contains two classes, which are complete: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">HelloServer;</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">TestHelloServer</span> which runs the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need the <span class="PA">telnet</span> program as in Activity 9.4.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To connect to a server on the local machine, using the <span class="PA">HelloServer</span> class.</p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Run the project to start up the server.  You should get a message indicating that the
server is starting up.  The server is set to listen on port 3000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are to use <span class="PA">telnet</span> as a client.  For this activity
you do not need to be connected to the internet.  See Activity 9.4 for instructions
about starting up <span class="PA">telnet</span> if you have not done this before.
At the prompt type <span class="PA">telnet localhost 3000</span> and then press enter.
The <span class="PA">localhost</span> address is a special name indicating the
computer on which the  <span class="PA">telnet</span> program is running.  The
 <span class="PA">3000</span> indicates the port number to be used by the server.
 </p>

<p>You should see a reply from the server and then that the server closes down.
This causes an end to the  <span class="PA">telnet</span> connection and the message
<span class="PA">"connection to host lost"</span> should appear - this does not indicate a problem.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to try again, you have to run the project again to restart the server
and then type the <span class="PA">telnet</span> command again, as above.</p>
</li>

</ol>
