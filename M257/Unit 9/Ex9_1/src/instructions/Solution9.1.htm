<h1>Discussion of Activity 9.1 - Testing the <span class="PA">WebReader</span> class</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>This should be a straightforward activity since you do not have to change any Java code.
However, there are a number of things which might go wrong.  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>
If you are not connected to the internet
or if the website is not available, the program should throw an exception with an appropriate error message.
Try with a browser as in the next part of the activity, to see if this is the problem.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>It is also possible that you experience connection problems if you have
a firewall installed on your machine, and if the settings are too restricted for this kind of exercise.
Please read through the advice in the firewall file associated with this project.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
If you get a compilation error message, this probably means that you have accidentally
changed something in the code and you should go back to the original version of this code.<br>
</p></li>

</ul>
<li><p>
Using the browser, you should see exactly the same HTML source as in part 1.
You may get problems similar to part 1 if you are not connected to the internet or
if the website is not available.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>The possible problems here are similar to those in part 1.  You may be more likely to
get a compilation error message this time as you are editing the source code.  If this
does occur, check carefully that you have the quotes and the punctuation in the URL correct.
You may also have chosen a non-existent URL so check with a browser if in doubt.</p>

<p>If you are using a connection over an intranet, you are probably operating from
behind a company's firewall. In that case you may not be able to look at the
source code for other websites, and part 3 of this activity is not possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
