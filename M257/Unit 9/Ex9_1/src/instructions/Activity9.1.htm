<h1>Activity 9.1 - Testing the <span class="PA">WebReader</span> class</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity you will test the <span class="PA">WebReader</span> class explained in Unit 9,
which allows you to display the HTML source of a web page.
</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project
for this exercise contains two classes, which are complete: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">WebReader;</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">TestWebReader</span>, which allows you to test the <span class="PA">WebReader</span> class. </li>
</ul>
<p>The project also contains an html file with additional advice on how to adjust the
settings of firewall software that you may have installed on your machine and to stop
it from interfering with your network programming activities throughout this unit. </p>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>You are to use the <span class="PA">WebReader</span> class
to connect to the home page of the Open University website and display its HTML source.
You are also to connect to the same web page using a browser and compare the source.</p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, make sure you are connected to the internet.
If you are using a dial-up link, you should have dialled
in and established a link.  Now run the project - this should display the HTML
source for the home page of the Open University at the URL specified in the <span class="PA">main</span> method of
the class <span class="PA">TestWebReader</span></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use a browser to view the same web page as before.  Use the View Source option to look at the
HTML source of this page.  It should be the same as the output from the <span class="PA">TestWebReader</span> program</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Edit the URL specified in the <span class="PA">main</span> method of
the class <span class="PA">TestWebReader</span> so that it refers to a different web page whose URL you know.
Run the program again and check whether the output is as you would expect.
</p>
</li>
