<h1>Activity 9.4 - Accessing a server using Telnet</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>
In this activity we use a standard client program called <span
 class="PA">telnet</span> to
access a server over the internet.
</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, you will need to have the the <span
 class="PA">telnet</span>
program, which is supplied as standard on most platforms.
There is no additional Java code provided for this activity.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To use the <span class="PA">telnet</span> program as a means of
contacting servers over the internet. </p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to be connected to the internet before you begin.
Open a command prompt window
(on Windows you would typically do this by clicking Start, then
Programs, Accessories,
Command Prompt, but the exact details may vary depending on your
operating system.)
At the prompt type <span class="PA">telnet HOSTNAME</span> and then
press enter
- where <span class="PA">HOSTNAME</span> should be the URL of a
host that accepts <span class="PA">telnet</span> requests.
There are fewer hosts available now than in the early days of the internet, so 
do not be surprised if some you try are no longer working.
A list of sites that may work can be found by googling, for example
there were some listed at <a href="http://telnet.org/htm/places.htm"> telnet.org </a>

when we last checked.</p>
    
    <p><span class="PA">telnet</span> stands for Terminal Emulation
Network software
and was at one time (before the Web) a common way of accessing
resources on remote
computer systems. With the wide availability of the Web and increasing
concern
about security, many sites no longer offer <span class="PA">telnet</span>
access and ssh has become more common. Don't worry if you don't manage
to connect to a telnet site; you won't need to be able to do this for M257. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you successfully connect to a site, you should see
some sort of information in the command prompt window - perhaps just
that, or perhaps an invitation to select
further options from a menu by pressing a particular key. You can
explore this
as much or as little as you like - the point of this exercise is to
explore
connecting to a server using the <span class="PA">telnet</span>
client. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you quit from a particular site, or when the site
disconnects you, there will
normally be a message such as <span class="PA">"connection to host
lost"</span>. You can then
return to step 1 and try another site if you wish.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>To enable <span class="PA">telnet</span> on Vista or Windows 7 you
may need to
do the following:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>From your Windows Start button, select Control Panel, click
Programs and features, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.
(Enter a password or provide confirmation if asked to do so.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Windows Features tick the check box for Telnet Client.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click OK and wait for the installation to complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>When you have finished this activity you are advised to disable
the client again, for security reasons. (However, <span class="PA">telnet</span>
is used again in
Activities 9.5 and 9.7)<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In Windows XP the <span class="PA">telnet</span> client is normally
enabled by default.<br>
