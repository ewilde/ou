<h1>Discussion of Activity 9.4 - Accessing a server using Telnet</h1>
<p>If you do not have <span class="PA">telnet</span> on your system,
you should be able to download a free copy from the web for any
computing platform.
</p>
<p>If for any reason you are not connected to the internet, or there is
no <span class="PA">telnet</span> site
at this address, you should get a message indicating that
<span class="PA">telnet</span> could not open a connection to the
specified host (ie the
computer at the URL you specified). In this case there is no point in
trying this particular connection with a browser, as the browser
expects to access a website on a different port. You could, however,
use a browser just to check that you are online.</p>
<p>The <span class="PA">telnet</span> program by default tries to
access the specified server
on port 23. You can specify the port to be used when you run <span
 class="PA">telnet</span>, for example like this:
<span class="PA">telnet HOSTNAME 23</span>. This should work just as
before.
If you try a different port number then most servers will not respond
to the request
as they will not be expecting <span class="PA">telnet</span> requests
on other ports.
If you write your own server, of course, you can choose which port it
listens to. In this
case you could use <span class="PA">telnet</span> to communicate with
the server on that port, which need not be
port 23. We will see how to do this a little later in this unit.
</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the <span class="PA">telnet</span> request
may not work on some sites, even
those suggested here or on the web as offering a telnet service.
If it still does not work after trying again a couple of times, you
may want to try another site, but don't spend too much time on this.
Please make sure you are trying the correct address - there is
no <span class="PA">www.</span> in the name
of telnet sites (as they are not websites). You will write your own
server later in the unit that will operate on similar principles.</p>

<p> If you wish to explore further, you may want to try downloading a client
supporting ssh, such as "putty" or "mintty" </p>

<p>Note that the Firewall advice you were given in the earlier
activities of this unit, is also
relevant to this activity, because again we are connecting to the
internet.<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>To enable <span class="PA">telnet</span> on Vista or Windows 7 you may need to
do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>From your Windows Start button, select Control Panel, click
Programs and features, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.
(Enter a password or provide confirmation if asked to do so.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Windows Features tick the check box for Telnet Client.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click OK and wait for the installation to complete.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
