<h1>Discussion of Activity 9.6 - Putting the simple client and server together</h1>


<p>It is important to ensure that the server is running before you try to run
the client.  To do this, you need to ensure that you run the project in the
server folder first.  The server should display a message
to indicate that it is starting up, and some further messages when the client
connects and when the server closes down.
</p>

<p>There is no special significance in using port 3000 - any port number could have
been used, although it is normally best to avoid numbers in the range 0-1023 some of
which are conventionally used for standard services.</p>

<p>You can experiment with using other port numbers by editing the
<span class="PA">PORT_NUMBER</span> constant in the class <span class="PA">HelloServer</span>.
You must, of course, make the corresponding change to the client code in the <span class="PA">HelloClient</span> class.
