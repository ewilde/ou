<h1>Activity 9.7 - Testing the name server</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity we try out the name server discussed in section 8.1
of Unit 9.
For a client we use the <span class="PA">telnet</span> program we met
in Activity 9.4.
</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project
for this exercise contains two classes, which are complete: </p>
<ul class="LS">
  <li><span class="PA">NameServer;</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">TestNameServer</span> which runs the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need the <span class="PA">telnet</span> program as in
Activity 9.4.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To use the <span class="PA">NameServer</span> class and the <span
 class="PA">telnet</span>
program, and to observe how they communicate.</p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Run the project to start up the server. You should get a message
indicating that the
server is starting up. The server is set to listen on port 3000.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are to use <span class="PA">telnet</span> as a client. For
this activity
you do not need to be connected to the internet. See Activity 9.4 for
instructions
about starting up <span class="PA">telnet</span> if you have not done
this before.
At the prompt type <span class="PA">telnet localhost 3000</span> and
then press enter.
The <span class="PA">localhost</span> address is a special name
indicating the
computer on which the <span class="PA">telnet</span> program is
running. The <span class="PA">3000</span> indicates the port number to
be used by the server. </p>
    <p>Once the <span class="PA">telnet</span> client has connected to
the server, the
server waits for a message from the client containing a user name. Type
one of the
user names listed in the <span class="PA">setUpNameDatabase</span>
method and press enter. Note that
the first name you type in may not be displayed on the screen.</p>
    <p>You should get a reply indicating the corresponding e-mail
address. Note
that you can only get a match for the email address if you had entered
the name exactly
as given, including capital letters. You can continue entering
as many user names as you like. Any user name not in the database
should receive
a reply indicating this fact. To terminate the connection, you enter <span
 class="PA">Exit</span> (exactly
like this) and press enter. This should close down the <span class="PA">telnet</span>
connection but does not cause the server to close. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the simple server in previous activities, this server
keeps running even
after the <span class="PA">telnet</span> client has terminated. You
can run the <span class="PA">telnet</span>
client again and send some more user names to the server. It should
respond as
before. The only way to end this server is to forcibly terminate the
program the program from NetBeans. </p>
  </li>
  <li>When you've finished this activity, you are advised to disable <span
 class="PA">telnet</span> for security reasons. See below for help on
doing this in Windows.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Disabling telnet service<br>
</h2>
<p>For Vista and Windows 7 to disable telnet<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to Control Panel and open Programs and Features</li>
  <li>Select Turn Windows features on and off</li>
  <li>Uncheck telnet client</li>
  <li>Click OK</li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows XP the client is enabled by default. The server should
normally be disabled. You can check here:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to Control panel and open Performance and Maintenance (or if
this is unavaiable, select Administrative Tools)</li>
  <li>Double click the Services icon</li>
  <li>Double click the Telnet icon</li>
  <li>Select startup type disabled</li>
  <li>Click OK<br>
  </li>
</ul>
