<h1>Activity 9.8 - Developing the full client-server name service</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>
In this activity we try out the name server discussed in section 8.1 of Unit 9,
using the client code discussed in section 8.2.  This is similar to Activity 9.7
except that we are using our own client code instead of the <span class="PA">telnet</span> client.
</p>

<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>For this activity there are two separate projects, <span class="PA">Ex9_8Server</span> and <span class="PA">Ex9_8Client</span>.
The instructions for this activity and the Solution document can be accessed
from both projects.</p>
<p><b>You should start from the server project if you have not already done this.</b>
</p>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the server project
for this exercise contains two classes, which are complete: </p>
<ul class="LS">
  <li><span class="PA">NameServer;</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">TestNameServer</span> which runs the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the client project also contains
two classes, which are complete: </p>
<ul class="LS">
  <li><span class="PA">NameClient;</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">TestNameClient</span> which runs the client.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To use the <span class="PA">NameClient</span> class and the <span class="PA">NameServer</span> class
and observe how they communicate. </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the project <span class="PA">Ex9_8Server</span> and run it, to start up the server.  You should get a message indicating that the
server is starting up.  The server is set to listen on port 3000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the project <span class="PA">Ex9_8Client</span> and run it.  For this activity
you do not need to be connected to the internet, since both the client and the
server are running on the same computer.  In this case, the client has a
graphical user interface (GUI).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the appropriate text box of the client GUI, enter a user name from those defined in
the <span class="PA">NameServer</span> method <span class="PA">setUpNameDatabase</span>.
Press the <span class="PA">Go</span> button to send the user name to the server.
You should see a reply from the server in the other text box, indicating either
the corresponding e-mail address or a message if the name cannot be found in the
database.  You can continue entering a user name and receiving a reply as many times
as you like.  To quit you click on the <span class="PA">Quit</span> button.  As in Activity 9.7,
this will cause the client to terminate but not the server.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The server continues running even after the client has terminated.  You can start up
another client by running the project again and then send some more user names to the server.
It should respond as before. Note that entering <span class="PA">Exit</span> as a username gives no response on the
user interface, but does close the server connection stream.</p>
<p>The server runs endlessly and can only be stopped by terminating it from NetBeans.
</p>
</li>

</ol>
