<h1>Discussion of Activity 9.9 - Using a threaded server</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It is important to ensure that the server is running before you try to run
the client.  To do this, you need to ensure that you run the project in the
server folder first.  The server should display a message
to indicate that it is starting up, and some further messages when the client
connects and when the server closes down.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The client program in this case is identical to the client used in Activity 9.8.
So it should behave in exactly the same way.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This server can deal with many clients apparently at once, by creating a thread to handle
the connection and communication with each client.  This concurrent handling of
multiple clients is much better than the sequential behaviour we saw in previous
activities.  For this reason all practical servers use threads or other means
to handle multiple clients concurrently.  We say "apparently at once" since the
server will normally only handle one message at a time from a client, but it can
normally switch its attention from one message to the next so quickly that it seems to be
simultaneous.
