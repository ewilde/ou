<h1>Activity 9.6 - Putting the simple client and server together</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>
In this activity we try out the simple server discussed in section 7.1 of Unit 9,
using the client code discussed in section 7.2.  This is similar to Activity 9.5
except that we are using our own client code instead of the <span class="PA">telnet</span> client.
</p>

<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>For this activity there are two separate projects, <span class="PA">Ex9_6Server</span> and <span class="PA">Ex9_6Client</span>.
The instructions for this activity and the Solution document can be accessed
from both projects.</p>
<p><b>You should start from the server project if you have not already done this.</b>
</p>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the server project
for this activity contains two classes, which are complete: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">HelloServer;</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">TestHelloServer</span> which runs the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the client project also contains
two classes, which are complete: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">HelloClient;</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">TestHelloClient</span> which runs the client.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important - before you start</h2>
<p>In this and the activities that follow you must ensure that no server processes are still running from a previous activity. Otherwise two server processes may compete for the same port, causing an exception.</p>

<p>Open the NetBeans Runtime window and expand the <span class="PA">Processes</span> node. Right-click on any running processes, then select <span class="PA">Terminate Process</span>.</p>


<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To run a server program and then a client program on the same machine, and to observe the communication between
these two programs.
</p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the project <span class="PA">Ex9_6Server</span> and run it, to start up the server.  You should get a message indicating that the
server is starting up.  The server is set to listen on port 3000.</p>
<p>Note that if you have a firewall running you may be asked if you want to allow
<span class="PA">javaw.exe</span> to act as a server. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the project <span class="PA">Ex9_6Client</span>, set it as the main project,
 and run it.  For this activity
you do not need to be connected to the internet, since both the client and the
server are running on the same computer.  In this case, the client does not have
a user interface as all it does is connect to the server, receive and display
a message, and then terminate.
</p>

<p>You should see a reply from the server.
The connection between the client and the server should then be closed and both
programs will terminate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to try again, you have to run the server project again to restart the server
and then run the client project again, as before.</p>
</li>

</ol>
