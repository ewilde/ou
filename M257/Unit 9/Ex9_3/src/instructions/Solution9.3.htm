<h1>Discussion of Activity 9.3 - <span class="PA">Ping</span>-ing a website</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If for any reason you are not connected to the internet, you should get a message indicating that
<span class="PA">ping</span> could not find the specified host (ie the
computer at the URL you specified).  As usual, if in doubt, try the connection with a browser.</P>
<p>You may also wish to read the advice on how to deal with firewalls given in Activity 9.1.</p>

<p>If successful, you should see that <span class="PA">ping</span> reports some statistics
for the time taken in milliseconds for each data packet to get there and back.
It also shows the numerical IP address corresponding to the symbolic name used.
To do this, the <span class="PA">ping</span> request has used the Internet DNS
to find the numerical IP address.
</p>

<p>The <span class="PA">ping</span> may not always work;
sometimes a request can time out.  Some sites do not respond to <span class="PA">ping</span> messages.
If it still does not work after trying again a couple of times, you will need to try another web site</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When trying other sites, it may be interesting to choose some sites close to where you are
and others very far away, perhaps on other continents, so see how fast the data travels.
As before if the <span class="PA">ping</span> request times out, try again or try another site.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you <span class="PA">ping</span> our own computer's symbolic name when connected to
the internet you should find your own numerical IP address.  If you are offline, you should get a different
numerical IP address, 127.0.0.1, the so-called loopback address.  This is a special IP address which always
refers to the local host computer - it is discussed in more detail later in the unit.
