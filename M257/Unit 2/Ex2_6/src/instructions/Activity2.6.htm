<h1>Activity 2.6 - Experimenting with <span class="PA">for</span> loops</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity practises using <span class="PA">for</span> loops. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the discussion of the solution in the Solution document, the project
for this activity contains two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class="PA">Ex2_6</span>, for which you need to supply additional code;
  </li>
  <li> <span class="PA">Main</span>, which is run to test the code. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tasks </h2>
<p>The class <span class="PA">Ex2_6</span> contains three unfinished methods: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <span class="PA">countDownFrom(int startingValue)</span>, whose purpose is to print out the whole
numbers from <span class="PA">startingValue</span> down to zero; </li>
  <li> <span class="PA">totalFromOneTo(int finalValue)</span>, which adds up all the integers from <span class="PA">1</span> to
<span class="PA">finalValue </span>inclusive; </li>
  <li> <span class="PA">howManySquaresUpTo(int limit)</span>, which works out how many of the squares of
the integers between 1 and <span class="PA">limit</span> inclusive are no bigger than <span class="PA">limit</span>, and prints
the result. (To find the square of a number, multiply it by itself.) </li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Open class <span class="PA">Ex2_6</span> and complete the unfinished methods in turn. Run the project
after each modification to test the modifications. You can assume that each
method receives a sensible argument. We will discuss how to deal with error
conditions in a later unit. </p>
<p>With the test value given the results of the second task should be 5151 and
10 </p>
