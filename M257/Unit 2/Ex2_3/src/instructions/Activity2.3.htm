<h1>Activity 2.3 - Using <span class="PA">if</span> statements</h1>

<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>This activity is about nested <span class="PA">if</span> statements. </p>

<h2>Materials </h2>

<p>In addition to the discussion of the solution in the Solution document, the
project for this activity contains two classes: </p>

<ul>
 <li><span class="PA">Ex2_3</span>, which you are
     asked to modify; </li>
 <li><span class="PA">Main</span>, which is run to test the code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task </h2>

<p>Imagine Alice has purchased a software licence on-line. She already has a trial version of
the software. In an email message she is sent a user identification number and
a registration code. By entering these, the trial version is converted into a
full one. </p>

<p>The activity is to complete the method <span class="PA">checkLicence</span>,
which compares two integers entered from the keyboard with stored values and
accepts the registration if both agree. Otherwise the user is invited to try
again. </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>

<p>Open the class <span class="PA">Ex2_3</span> and add additional code to the
method <span class="PA">checkLicence</span> where indicated. </p>

<p>When you have made the required changes, run the project to test your
solution. Make sure it works correctly in all four possible cases (i.e., both
numbers are right, one or the other of the numbers is wrong, or both numbers
are wrong). When prompted for your details, enter them into the window at
the bottom of the NetBeans screen and press the Enter key. </p>

 input from the keyboard."
 </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p>The statements that read the numbers from the keyboard are already supplied
for you. They make use of an object of a utility class <span class="PA">Scanner</span>.
The details of how this class works have been deliberately kept behind the scenes, 
in accordance with the principle of information hiding, but you will learn more about
the Scanner class in Unit 4.</p>
