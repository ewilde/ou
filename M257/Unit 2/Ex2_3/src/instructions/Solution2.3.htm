<h1>Discussion of Activity 2.3 - Using <span class="PA">if</span> statements</h1>


<p>An example solution is shown below.
The first condition checks to see if the user ID the user entered from the keyboard,
stored in the variable <span class="PA">id</span>
is the same as the value stored in the variable <span class="PA">userID</span>.
If it is, we can check the entered <span class="PA">code</span> to see if it matches the stored
<span class="PA"> registrationCode</span>. This second condition is tested by a nested
<span class="PA">if</span>.
</p>

<p>We have taken the view that there is no need to check the registration code if the user ID was 
incorrect, as the registration cannot be accepted.
</p>

<p>We have not shown code to allow the user to re-enter their details, as we have not yet 
covered the programming structures you require to do this.
</p>


<pre>
if (id == userID)
{
   if (code == registrationCode)
   {
      //Both correct!
      System.out.println("Your registration is accepted.");
   }
   else
   {
      //The id was correct but then the code was wrong.
      System.out.println("Sorry, your registration code was incorrect. Please try  again.");
   }
}
else
{
   //The id was wrong.
   System.out.println("Sorry, your userID was incorrect. Please try again.");
}
</pre>
