<h1>Activity 2.7 - Using <span class="PA">for</span> loops with data
stored in arrays</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity uses arrays and <span class="PA">for</span> loops to
create a simple bar graph. Please read the notes at the end of this
file.<br>
</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the discussion of the solution in the Solution
document, the project
for this activity contains two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class="PA">Ex2_7</span>, which you will need to add code
to in three places; </li>
  <li> <span class="PA">Main</span>, which is run to test the code. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tasks </h2>
<p>The objective is to print out a bar graph illustrating some data
about the
number of classes in successive Java versions, like this, in which each
hash
mark indicates one hundred classes. </p>
<pre>1.0   |##<br>      |<br>1.1   |#####<br>      |<br>1.2   |##################<br>      |<br>1.3   |#####################<br>      |<br>1.4   |##############################<br>      |<br>      |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|<br>      Hundreds of classes in successive versions of Java</pre>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Read the comments and complete the code for <span class="PA">Ex2_7</span>
by completing: </p>
<ol>
  <li>the method <span class="PA">printHashMarks(int i)</span>, which
prints as many hash marks as the
value stored in <span class="PA">i</span>, and then prints a newline
character; </li>
  <li>the <span class="PA">for</span> loop condition in <span
 class="PA">plotGraph</span>, so that all versions of Java are
included; </li>
  <li>the print statement in the <span class="PA">for</span> loop in <span
 class="PA">plotGraph</span>, to print labels on the axis. </li>
</ol>
<p>Run the project to test your answer. </p>
<h2>Notes </h2>
<p>1. As of NetBeans 6.9, there has been a bug in the way NetBeans
handles
the tab character in the output window and so the output may not align
correctly. If in doubt, please check the discussion of this activity to
check your understanding.<br>
</p>
<p>2. The code uses more than one kind of print statement: <span
 class="PA">print()</span> prints its
argument, while <span class="PA">println()</span> prints its argument
and a newline character, so that
the next output begins on the following line of the screen. A <span
 class="PA">println()</span>
statement with no argument simply prints a newline character. </p>
