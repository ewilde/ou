<h1>Discussion of Activity 2.9 - Adding methods to the <span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span> class
</h1>
<p>We have asked you to ignore the section at the beginning of
<span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span>, where we have used some code that has not yet been
discussed. This code defines a 'constructor' to intialize an object of type
<span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span>.  You will see more about this kind of code in Unit 3.</p>
<p>The methods that were to be completed were</p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="PA">isInNetwork</span>, which returns true or false according to the value returned
  by the <span class="PA">indexOf</span> method. If <span class="PA">indexOf</span> returns a non-negative value, then the searched for computer exists in the <span class="PA">computers</span> collection, otherwise it is not found.

<pre>
// use the indexOf method to tell if a computer is in the network
public boolean isInNetwork(String wantedComputer)
{
   boolean found;
   if (indexOf(wantedComputer) &gt; -1)
   {
      found = true;
   }
   else
   {
      found = false;
   }
   return found;
}</pre></li>
<li>Keeping track of the number of removals requires no more than
 incrementing the instance variable storing this information, so at the
 end of the <span class="PA">removeComputer</span> method we require the code:
<p class="PA">numOfRemovals++;</p>
<p>This must appear within the body of the last <span class="PA">if</span> statement, as it should only
be performed when a removal is performed.</p></li>
<li>A method to return the number of removals only needs to return the
value stored in the <span class="PA">numOfRemovals</span> variable:
<pre>// Method to return the number of removals
public int getNumOfRemovals()
{
   return numOfRemovals;
}
</pre>
</li></ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>There is another observation that is worth making here, concerning the
<span class="PA">addComputer</span> method of <span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span>. This method copies a reference to an
array of <span class="PA">Strings</span> called <span class="PA">computers.</span> Because strings are immutable, there is
no danger that the referenced string can be changed by any other part of the
program that has a reference to it. Normally, copying a reference does not
guarantee that the object referenced (if any) will not be altered by other parts
of the program.</p>
