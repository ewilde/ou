<h1>Activity 2.9 - Adding methods to the <span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span> class</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity involves adding methods to the existing <span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span>
class. It also requires an additional instance variable to be declared and
initialized, and an extra statement to be added to an existing method. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the discussion of the solution in the Solution document, the project
for this activity contains two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span>, to which you will need to add code in four places;
  </li>
  <li> <span class="PA">ComputerCollectionTest</span>, which is run to test the code.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tasks </h2>
<p>A <span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span> keeps track of computers connected to a network. (For
the purpose of our activity a computer is represented by a string corresponding
to its name.) Methods already exist to add a computer to the network, and to
remove a computer, as well as to tell the index of a computer in the collection.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Complete the method <span class="PA">isInNetwork</span> so that it returns <span class="PA">true</span> if its string argument is in the collection, and <span class="PA">false</span> otherwise, making use of the existing
<span class="PA">indexOf</span> method. </li>
  <li>Edit <span class="PA">removeComputer</span> so that it updates the <span class="PA">numOfRemovals</span> variable when a computer is removed from the collection. </li>
  <li>Add a method <span class="PA">getNumOfRemovals</span>, to return the value stored in <span class="PA">numOfRemovals</span>. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>The project will not compile at this stage. </p>
<p>Open the class <span class="PA">ComputerCollection</span> and study the code there. Read the comments
and insert the necessary statements at the numbered points. </p>
<p>Examine the class <span class="PA">ComputerCollectionTest</span> to see what it does with the
collection. Run the project to test your answer.</p>
