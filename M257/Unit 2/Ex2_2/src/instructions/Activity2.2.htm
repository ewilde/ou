<h1>Activity 2.2 - Experimenting with strings and concatenation</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity gives you practise in the use of string concatenation and
escape sequences. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the discussion of the solution in the Solution document, the project
for this activity contains two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class="PA">Ex2_2</span>, incomplete at present; </li>
  <li> <span class="PA">Main</span>, which is run to test the code. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>You are asked to build two strings which, when printed, will result in the
following output: </p>

<pre>Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson lived at No. 221B, Baker Street.
"ABC,
double-XYZ,"
she recited. </pre>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol><li>Run the project. You should find that to start with it simply prints the
message :
<span class="PA">End of output</span>. </li>
<li>Now open the class <span class="PA">Ex2_2</span> and read the method <span class="PA">output</span>. Follow the
instructions there. </li>
<li>When you have made the required changes, run the project to test whether your
solution is correct. </li>
<li>You might want to do the activity in stages, testing your output as you go.
</li></ol>
