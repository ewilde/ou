<h1>Discussion of Activity 2.2 - Experimenting with strings and concatenation</h1>
<p>
Here is an example solution <span class="PA">output</span> method. We have created two strings
referenced by the variables <span class="PA">printout1</span> and <span class="PA">printout2</span>. The <span class="PA">println</span> statements
print the strings referenced by those variables. Notice how the quotation
marks in the second and third lines of output needed to be formed using an
escape sequence <span class="PA">(\&quot;)</span>. We also included two newline characters to start output on
a new line where necessary. The newline character is also formed by an escape
sequence <span class="PA">(\n)</span>.</p>
<pre>public void output()
{
   String name1 = "Sherlock Holmes";
   String name2 = "Dr. Watson";
   String number = "221B";
   String street = "Baker Street.";
   String printout1; //first line of output
   String printout2; //remaining lines of output
   printout1 = name1 + " and " + name2 + " lived at No. " +
               number + ", " + street;
   System.out.println(printout1);
   printout2 = "\"ABC,\ndouble-XYZ,\"\nshe recited.";
   System.out.println(printout2);
}</pre>
