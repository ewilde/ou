<h1>Activity 2.5 - Using arrays</h1>

<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>This activity is about array access. </p>

<h2>Materials </h2>

<p>In addition to the discussion of the solution in the Solution document, the
project for this activity contains two classes: </p>

<ul>
<li><span class="PA">Ex2_5</span>, for which you need to supply additional code;</li>

<li><span class="PA">Main</span>, which is run to test the code. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks </h2>

<p>It
is common to list the planets of the Solar System in order of their distance
from the Sun. However, many people have trouble remembering how the order goes.
The method <span class="PA">selectAPlanet</span> was supposed to help with this, but unfortunately the programmer left
out some segments of code:</p>

<ul>
<li>The check that
the user submits a sensible planet number is incomplete; </li>

<li>The code to
print a planet's name was omitted; </li>

<li>Pluto was omitted from the list of planets. (Pluto isn't considered to be a planet.) </li>
</ul>

<p>The existing method runs but does not produce correct output. Your job is to
supply the missing code. </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>

<ol>
 <li>Run the project. You should find it prompts
     for a planet number. At this point you need to type a number in the window
     at the bottom of the NetBeans window and press Enter. The code
     should then print a planet name, but does not.</li>


<li>Open
the class <span class="PA">Ex2_5</span> and type in code missing from the method <span class="PA">selectAPlanet</span> at the two places indicated by comments. Don't
forget that in Java the index of an array starts at 0, not 1. Re-run the project to check planet names are correctly printed. </li>

<li>Now
modify the method to add <span class="PA">&quot;Pluto&quot;</span> to the array <span class="PA">planets</span>. If you have made the other changes in the right
way, the program should still run properly, without further modification.
Confirm this by executing the revised version. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p>This project makes use of
the utility class <span class="PA">Scanner</span> to perform keyboard input. This class
is discussed in Unit 4.</p>
