<h1>Activity 2.1 - Experimenting with data types and operators</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity gives you the opportunity to practise working with arithmetic
operators and using brackets to clarify their order of evaluation. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the discussion of the solution in the Solution document, the project
for this activity contains two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">Ex2_1</span>, which you are asked to modify; </li>
  <li><span class="PA">Main</span>, which is run to test the code. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>Five integers have already been declared for you in the locations named <span class="PA">A</span>, <span class="PA">B</span>,
<span class="PA">C</span>, <span class="PA">D</span> and <span class="PA">E</span> and assigned values that are to be used unchanged in the activity.
</p>
<p>Your task is to use these five values and each of the four operators <span class="PA">+</span>, <span class="PA">-</span>, <span class="PA">*</span>
and <span class="PA">/</span>, to build up an expression. The value of the expression should be as large
as possible. Each value and operator is to be used once and once only. Brackets
should be used to ensure the order of evaluation is the one you intend. </p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Run the project: you should find the result is <span class="PA">1</span> initially. </p>
<p>Open the class <span class="PA">Ex2_1</span> and read the method <span class="PA">calculate</span>. </p>
<p>Edit the line </p>
<p class="PS">result = ((A + B) - (C * D)) / E; </p>
<p>Try to change the order in which the variables and operators appear so that
the expression will have the largest possible value. You can test the effect of
each modification you make by running the project again. </p>
<p>Your target is to get more than 3000. Good luck! </p>
<p>Please don't spend too long on this activity. It's only meant to let you
practice with Java arithmetical operations - we aren't trying to test your
mathematical skills! </p>
