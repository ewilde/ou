<h1>Activity 7.6 - Running the <span class="PA">ColourAdjust</span> program</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity gives you an opportunity to experiment with running the
<span class="PA">ColourAdjust</span> application. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>We have provided the following classes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">ColourAdjust</span>, which demonstrates RGB colours; </li>
  <li><span class="PA">ColourPanel</span>, which displays a colour; </li>
  <li><span class="PA">ColourAdjustTest</span>, which is the <span class="PA">main</span> class. </li>
</ul>
<p>and a colour chart<span class="PA"> custom colours.png</span>.</p>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>We require six custom colours for use in Activity 7.7. The colours we want,
and the names we have given them, appear in the colour chart below. Your task is
to find the Red, Green and Blue values for these colours. An exact match is not
necessary; just get as near as you are able. </p>

<p><img src="Activity7.6_files/image001.png"
alt = "A strip of six coloured blocks labelled from left to right:
pink, green, blue, yellow, mauve and steel. ">
</p>

<p>We have added a copy of this colour chart to the project.
This file is called <span class="PA">custom colours.png</span> - if you
open it, you can compare the colours easily.
Alternatively you can just have the  <span class="PA">ColourAdjust </span> window open next to these
instructions. </p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Run the program,
setting <span class="PA">ex7_6.ColourAdjustTest</span> as the main class. </p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with the sliders. Try each of Red, Green and Blue separately. Then
try setting all three to 255. See what happens if you set two sliders to 255 and
the third to 0. There are three such combinations, and they should give magenta,
yellow and cyan, which are three of the pre-defined Java colours. </p></li>
<li><p>Now move the sliders about until you find RGB combinations that come as close
as you can get to the six custom colours shown above. Make a note of the
corresponding RGB values, so you will be able to reproduce the colour for the
next activity. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any problems in matching the colours you can find some suggested RGB values in the Solution file.
