<h1>Activity 7.4 - Creating a coloured word game</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>This activity looks at fonts and colours. </p>

<p>In the window below colours of the words don't match the colour names. Try to
go quickly from top left to bottom right saying aloud what the colours of the
words are (not what the <u>words</u> are, i.e. the first thing you should say is
'red'). It's very difficult! </p>

<p><img border=0 width=240 height=240

alt= "A window with the words Red, Blue, Yellow and Green randomly ordered in a 3 by 4 grid.
There are three instances of each word and each instance is displayed using one of the
four colours but not its own colour. The background of the window is black."></p>

<p>This is known as the <i>Stroop effect</i>, after its discoverer. Your task is to
write a Java program to display such a window. </p>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>We want you to write the program so that each word occupies a separate panel
of its own and the panels are then arranged on the content pane of a frame, in a
grid layout. </p>
<p>A panel will have two attributes, colour and word, and when it is made
visible it will display the given word using the given colour. </p>
<p>When the enclosing frame is made visible the panels it holds will
automatically be displayed as well, and so the coloured words will appear.</p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a new project <span class="PA">MyEx7_4</span> in the Unit 7 folder, naming the main class <span class="PA">myex7_4.CrazyColorsTest</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>Add a class <span class="PA">ColorPanel</span> to the current project. This class should have two instance
variables to represent the colour and the word, and a two-argument constructor
<span class="PA">ColorPanel(Color c, String s)</span> that sets these attributes.
The <span class="PA">paint</span> method in
<span class="PA">ColorPanel</span> should set the current graphics colour using the colour attribute of
the panel, set the current font to 18-point bold serif, then use the method
<span class="PA">drawString(String,int,int)</span>to display the word. The two int arguments determine
where on the panel the word will be displayed; you will probably need to
experiment with the numbers to get the position right. </p></li>
<li><p>Next add a class <span class="PA">CrazyColors</span> that extends <span class="PA">JFrame</span>.
Its constructor should set
the title, size and so on in the usual way, then get the content pane and set it
to a grid layout. </p>
<p>The constructor should then create 12 instances of <span class="PA">ColorPanel</span>, with suitable
colours and words for demonstrating the <i>Stroop effect</i>, and add them to the
content pane. However for testing purposes we suggest you create only one panel
to start with, adding the others later once you know a panel displays correctly.
</p></li>
<li><p>Finally complete <span class="PA">CrazyColorsTest</span> so it creates an instance of <span class="PA">CrazyColors</span> and makes it visible. Run your program to test it. </p></li></ol>
<p>For our sample solutions see classes <span class="PA">ColorPanel</span>,
<span class="PA">CrazyColors</span> and <span class="PA">CrazyColorsTest</span> in the Solution file.</p>
