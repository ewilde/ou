<h1>Activity 3.3 - Writing a <span class="PA">toString</span> method</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity we shall write a <span class="PA">toString</span> method that overrides the one
inherited from <span class="PA">Object</span>. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this activity contains
two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">RoomID</span>, whose <span class="PA">toString</span> method is to be written.</li>
  <li><span class="PA">RoomIDTest</span> to test the <span class="PA">toString</span> method. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>The <span class="PA">RoomID</span> class is to be provided with a method </p>
<pre>String toString() </pre>
<p>that will return a string saying that the object is a room ID and describing
the values of the instance variables (the <span class="PA">blockName</span> and <span class="PA">roomNumber</span> of the <span class="PA">RoomID</span>
object). </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li>Run the project and you will see the output resulting from using the
inherited <span class="PA">toString</span> method. </li>
<li>Open the class <span class="PA">RoomID</span> and insert a <span class="PA">toString</span> method that returns a more
informative string. </li>
<li>Run the project to check that the method works as you intend. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
You may have noticed that the editor has added a lightbulb symbol to the left
of the <span class="PA">equals</span> method, as shown in the following
screenshot.
</p>

<div align="center"><br>
  <img src="Solution3.3_files/hints and tips.png" alt="a lightbulb appears in the editor left-hand margin">

  <p> If you click on this symbol you will see a suggestion to add an <span class="PA">@Override</span>
      annotation.
  </p>

  <div align="center"><br>
  <img src="Solution3.3_files/add Override annotation.png" alt="clicking on add Override annotation">

  <p>If you click on this hint, the <span class="PA">@Override</span> annotation is added for you.
  This annotation indicates that the following method is intended
  to override an inherited method.
  If you use this annotation and the method following it does not override
  any methods, a compilation error will result. This is a useful check
  that you are doing what you intended to do, and also a reminder when
  reading code that you are overriding an inherited method. 
  </p>

  <p>You may like to add this annotation whenever you intend to override a method.
      For example, you may like to use it now on your <span class="PA">toString</span> method. You can type
  it in manually if you want to.</p>

  <p>There are also other useful hints available using the lightbulb symbol, but
  you are not required to use such hints in assignments.
  Using such hints may lead you to a different solution than
  the one intended by a question.</p>
