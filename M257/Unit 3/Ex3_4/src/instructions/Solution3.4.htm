<h1>Discussion of Activity 3.4 - Putting it all together</h1>
<p><br>
Your task here was to complete the <span class="PA">Member</span> class.&nbsp;&nbsp; The project cannot
be run, initially, as the <span class="PA">TestMember</span> class assumes certain things will be defined by
<span class="PA">Member</span>, which is incomplete</p>
<p>Below is the definition of the class <span class="PA">Member</span>:</p>

<pre>
public class Member
{
   //Note that these variables should be declared private
   private String name;
   private String emailAddress;
   private String homeAddress;

   // A three-argument constructor for Member
   public Member(String nam, String ema, String adr)
   {
      name = nam;
      emailAddress = ema;
      homeAddress = adr;
   }

   // getter methods
   public String getName()
   {
      return name;
   }

   public String getEmailAddress()
   {
      return emailAddress;
   }

   public String getHomeAddress()
   {
      return homeAddress;
   }

   // setter methods
   public void setName(String s)
   {
      name = s;
   }

   public void setEmailAddress(String s)
   {
      emailAddress = s;
   }

   public void setHomeAddress(String s)
   {
      homeAddress = s;
   }


   //This is one possible string representation of a Member
   public String toString()
   {
      return  getName() + ", email address " +
              getEmailAddress() + ", home address " + getHomeAddress();
   }

   /* an example equals method, assuming that we should compare
    * all instance variables of two Member objects to determine equality of Members
    */

   public boolean equals(Object o)
   {
      // cast the passed object to type Member (potentially fails)
      Member mem = (Member) o;
      return  name.equals(mem.getName()) &&
              emailAddress.equals(mem.getEmailAddress()) &&
              homeAddress.equals(mem.getHomeAddress());
   }
}</pre>
