<h1>Activity 3.4 - Putting it all together</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity you will practise what you have learnt by writing a complete
class <span class="PA">Member</span>. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this activity contains
two classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">Member</span>, a class so far empty, but for comments! </li>
  <li><span class="PA">MemberTest</span>, which will test your class when you have written it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>Instances of <span class="PA">Member</span> represent members of a local conservation group. </p>
<p>Requirements: </p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="PA">Member</span> is to have three instance variables, representing a name, email
  address and home address. You will need to define suitable instance variables
  to represent these, and write a getter and a setter method for each attribute.
  </li>
  <li>The class should have a single three-argument constructor that allows
  <span class="PA">Member</span> objects to be created with a given name, email address and home address
  (in that order). </li>
  <li>The class should be equipped with an appropriate <span class="PA">toString()</span> method,
  which returns a string describing a <span class="PA">Member</span> object's contents in a readable
  form. </li>
  <li>The class should have an <span class="PA">equals(Object o)</span> method that returns <span class="PA">true</span> if the
  object on which the method is invoked has identically valued instance
  variables to the object referenced by the argument, and <span class="PA">false</span> otherwise. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Write the code for the class <span class="PA">Member</span> to comply with requirements above and run
the project to test what you have done. </p>
