<h1>Activity 3.6 - Writing a subclass that overrides a superclass method</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity you will develop a subclass <span class="PA">CommitteeMember</span> that
extends <span class="PA">Member</span>. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this activity
contains: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">CommitteeMember</span>, a class that is to extend <span class="PA">Member</span> but is empty so far,
  apart from comments! </li>
  <li><span class="PA">Member</span>, instances of which represent members of a local conservation
  group. This is the class used in Activities 3.4 and 3.5. </li>
  <li><span class="PA">GroupRecord</span>, an instance of which stores a list of <span class="PA">Member</span> objects. This is
  essentially the same class as the solution class in Activity 3.5</li>
  <li><span class="PA">GroupRecordTest</span>, which will test the <span class="PA">CommitteeMember</span> class that you
  write. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>You are to write the class <span class="PA">CommitteeMember</span> to extend <span class="PA">Member</span>, and add an extra
instance variable <span class="PA">position</span>, which records the office a committee member holds,
for example Secretary, Treasurer etc. </p>
<p>The class should have a four-argument constructor that sets all the instance
variables, and a getter for the new attribute. </p>
<p>The <span class="PA">toString</span> method inherited from <span class="PA">Member</span> is to be overridden so that it will
return a string including a committee member's position in addition to the
details supplied for an ordinary member. </p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Complete the code for the class <span class="PA">CommitteeMember</span>, as specified above, and run
the project to test what you have written. </p>
