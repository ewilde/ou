<h1>Activity 3.5 - Using an array of a reference type</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity you will develop a class <span class="PA">GroupRecord</span> which uses the class
you wrote for the last activity. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this activity contains
the classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">GroupRecord</span>, a class so far empty but for comments!</li>
  <li><span class="PA">Member</span>, instances of which represent members of a local conservation
  group. This is the class <br>you wrote in Activity 3.4. </li>
  <li><span class="PA">GroupRecordTest</span>, which will test your <span class="PA">GroupRecord</span> class when you have
  written it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>You are asked to develop a class an instance of which will maintain a list of
<span class="PA">Member</span> objects in an array, and provide methods to locate and access the stored
objects. </p>
<p>The class requires: </p>
<ol>
  <li>an array of <span class="PA">Member</span> objects, with a default size of 100. </li>
  <li>an instance variable to record how many members are currently listed. </li>
  <li>a single zero-argument constructor that initialises the array variable to
  a new array of the default size, and the other variable to zero. </li>
  <li>three public methods: </li>

<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">addMember(Member mem)</span>, which adds a member to the list;</li>
  <li><span class="PA">getEmailAddressForMember(String membersName)</span>, which retrieves an email
  address given the member's name;</li>
  <li><span class="PA">getHomeAddressForMember(String membersName)</span>, which retrieves a home
  address given the member's name. </li>
</ul>
<li>a helper method <span class="PA">findIndex(String name)</span> that will locate the
array index at which the Member's name passed as an argument is stored in the
array. <br>
You may assume the array will always contain the object in question. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Write the code for the class <span class="PA">GroupRecord</span> to comply with the requirements
above and run the project to test what you have done.</p>
