<h1>Discussion of Activity 3.2 - Using the <span class="PA">CarTracker</span> class</h1>

<p>We have supplied a separate solution file called <span class="PA">TreasureHunt_Solution.java</span>, which shows one way to
solve the problem.</p>

<p>Notice that there are two classes in this project that have <span class="PA">main</span>
methods: <span class="PA">TreasureHunt_Solution</span>
and the class we asked you to edit to write your own solution, called <span class="PA">TreasureHunt</span>. </p>

<p>There is more than one approach to running the solution file. </p>

<ol>
 <li>Select the node <span class="PA">TreasureHunt_Solution.java</span> in the Projects window. Right-click on this file name and choose
     <span class="PA">Run File</span>.</li>
 <li>An alternative approach to use when you want
     to change the default main class is to edit the information contained in
     the project properties. In the Projects window, right-click on the project
     node <span class="PA">Ex3_2</span>
     and choose <span class="PA">Properties</span>. 
     When the Project Properties window opens, click <span class="PA">Run</span>
     in the <span class="PA">Categories:</span> pane at the
     left.
     The Main Class for the project is currently <span class="PA">ex3_2.TreasureHunt</span>.
 </li>

<div align="center"><br>
  <img src="Solution3.2_files/image001.png" alt="The project properties dialogue">
  

<p>Click the <span class="PA">Browse</span> button and the Browse Main Classes
dialogue will open. Click on <span class="PA">ex3_2.TreasureHunt_Solution</span>
to select it as the main class.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="Solution3.2_files/image003.png" alt="selecting an alternative main class">
</div>
<p>Click the <span class="PA">Select Main Class</span> button, and then <span class="PA">OK</span>.</p>

<p>Now <span class="PA">TreasureHunt_Solution.java</span>
can be run by choosing <span class="PA">Run|Run Main Project</span> or by clicking the <span class="PA">Run Main
Project</span> button on the <span class="PA">NetBeans</span> toolbar.</p>
</ol>
<p>Note that the class you choose as the main class needs to contain a <span class="PA">main</span> method.</p>
