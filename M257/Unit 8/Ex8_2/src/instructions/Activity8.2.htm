<h1>Activity 8.2 - Running the hare and the tortoise race again</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity we create threads by implementing the <span class="PA">Runnable</span> interface.</p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>You will have to add your own classes to the project.</p>
<p>A discussion of the solution can be found in the Solution document.</p>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>You will continue with the example of the "Hare and the Tortoise" race from Activity 8.1, now using
a different approach for the threads. The classes developed in Activity 8.1 will need to be amended.
 </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>

<p>Write new classes <span class="PA">Hare</span> and <span class="PA">Tortoise</span> based on the specification in Activity 8.1,
but this time implementing the <span class="PA">Runnable </span> interface.
</p>
<p>Write a new class <span class="PA">ThreadRace2</span> which will create and start
threads from
the  <span class="PA">Hare</span> and <span class="PA">Tortoise</span> classes. The
class <span class="PA">ThreadRace2</span> should behave like <span class="PA">ThreadRace1</span> in all other respects.
</p>
<p>Compile the program and run it several times. The output should be like that of Activity 8.1.
