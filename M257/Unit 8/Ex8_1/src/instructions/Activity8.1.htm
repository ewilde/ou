<h1>Activity 8.1 - Running the hare and the tortoise race</h1>
<h2>Topic </h2>
<p>In this activity we create threads by extending the <span class="PA">Thread</span>
class. </p>
<h2>Materials </h2>
<p>You will have to add your own classes to the project.</p>
<p>A discussion of the solution can be found in the Solution document.</p>
<h2>Task </h2>
<p>The task is to simulate the race between the "Hare and the
Tortoise". </p>
<p>The class <span class="PA">Hare</span> is to extend <span
 class="PA">Thread</span>. Its <span class="PA">run()</span> method
will contain a for loop
that iterates from 1 to 50 000 000, testing each successive value of
the loop
variable to see if it is divisible by 1 000 000. This can be done by
using the
condition </p>
<p class="PS">if (i % 1000000 == 0) </p>
<p>Whenever the value of the loop variable is divisible by 1000000
(which will
happen exactly ten times) the string <span class="PA">"H "</span>
should be printed, using <span class="PA">print()</span> not
<span class="PA">println()</span> so the output will remain on the same
line. </p>
<p>The class <span class="PA">Tortoise</span> is to have a <span
 class="PA">run</span>
method identical to that of <span class="PA">Hare</span>,
except that it will print <span class="PA">"T "</span> instead of <span
 class="PA">"H "</span>. </p>
<p>A further class <span class="PA">ThreadRace1</span> will contain
the <span class="PA">main</span> method which creates
a <span class="PA">Hare</span>
instance and a <span class="PA">Tortoise</span> instance and sets them
running. </p>
<p>When the program executes, a typical printout will show output from
the <span class="PA">Hare</span> and
<span class="PA">Tortoise</span> objects interleaved, like this </p>
<p class="PS">They're off! H H H H H H T T T T T H H H H T T T T T </p>
<p>On this occasion the hare won (it finished first). On a different
occasion
the tortoise might be the winner; the outcome is not predictable.</p>
<h2>Instructions </h2>
<p>Write classes<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="PA">Hare</span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">Tortoise</span> and&nbsp;<span class="PA"></span></li>
  <li><span class="PA">ThreadRace1</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>as specified above. <br>
</p>
<p>You can create a new class by right-clicking on a project or folder
and selecting <span class="PA">New | Java Class</span>. (You can also
use the <span class="PA">File| New File</span> dialogue to create each
class.)
</p>
<p> In the New Class dialogue, create all the classes in the same
package, called <span class="PA">race</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>Once you've completed your coding, you also need to select the main
class to run. <br>
</p>
<p>Run the program several times. You should find that on different
runs the
race goes differently; sometimes it is won by the hare, sometimes by
the
tortoise. </p>
<p>(If you make a mistake about where you place a class, you can drag
it to the correct folder and select Refactor.)</p>
