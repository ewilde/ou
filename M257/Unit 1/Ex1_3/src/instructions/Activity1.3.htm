<h1>Activity 1.3 - Using inheritance with a <span class="PA">MagicRobot</span></h1>

<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>This exercise allows you to test the <span class="PA">MagicRobot</span>
class which extends the simple <span class="PA">Robot</span> class, as discussed
in the course text. </p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this exercise contains
three classes: </p>

<ul><li><span class="PA">Robot</span>, which is complete; </li>

<li><span class="PA">MagicRobot</span>, which inherits from <span class="PA">Robot</span>, and is also complete;</li>

<li><span class="PA">TestRobot</span>, which is incomplete. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Task </h2>

<p>In the test class <span class="PA">TestRobot</span>,
the code to create a <span class="PA">Robot</span> object and a <span class="PA">MagicRobot</span> object has been provided
for you. You are to complete this class by adding statements to invoke some of
the methods of the <span class="PA">MagicRobot</span>
class. </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>

<p>Add statements to invoke various methods, and to display the new state of
the <span class="PA">MagicRobot</span> object, as
indicated by the comments in the class <span class="PA">TestRobot</span>.
You may find it useful to look at the code for the <span class="PA">MagicRobot</span> class, as well as referring to the
explanation of this class in the course text. </p>

<p>Build and run the project and check that the effect of these methods is as
you would expect. </p>
