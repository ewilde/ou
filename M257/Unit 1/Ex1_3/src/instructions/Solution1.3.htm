<h1>Discussion of Activity 1.3 - Using inheritance with a <span class="PA">MagicRobot</span></h1>
<h2>Sample solution</h2>
<pre>
public class TestRobot
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      // Declare a variable to reference a Robot
      Robot meetoo;
      // Create a Robot object
      meetoo = new Robot(7,7);  // Initially at x=7, y=7
      System.out.println("Initially meetoo is at " + meetoo.getPosition());
      // Move the Robot named meetoo to the position x =5 and y =3
      meetoo.moveTo(5,3);
      System.out.println("Now meetoo is at " + meetoo.getPosition());
      // Declare a variable to reference a magic robot
      MagicRobot gandalf;
      // Create new robot object
      gandalf = new MagicRobot();
      System.out.println("Initially gandalf is at " + gandalf.getPosition() +
                         " and is visible: "        + gandalf.isVisible());
      gandalf.makeVisible();
      gandalf.moveNorth();
      gandalf.moveNorth();
      System.out.println("Now gandalf is at " + gandalf.getPosition() +
                         " and is visible: "  + gandalf.isVisible());
      gandalf.makeInvisible();
      gandalf.moveTo(3,3);
      System.out.println("Now gandalf is at " + gandalf.getPosition() +
                         " and is visible: "  + gandalf.isVisible());
   }
}
</pre>
<p>The expected output will be:</p>
<pre>Initially meetoo is at (7, 7)
Now meetoo is at (5, 3)
Initially gandalf is at (1, 1) and is visible: false
Now gandalf is at (1, 3) and is visible: true
Now gandalf is at (3, 3) and is visible: false
</pre>

Clearly this is not a very elegant way of indicating the visibility of a
<span class="PA">MagicRobot</span> object. We would really like to say
<span class="PA">"and is (not) visible"</span> but
we have not yet encountered the necessary Java constructs to do this. If
you already know some Java or similar languages, you may well have done this in
a more appropriate way.</p>
