<h2>Sample solution</h2>
<pre>
public class TestRobot
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      // Declare three variables to reference Robots
      Robot artoo;
      Robot deetoo;
      Robot meetoo;
      // Create three Robot objects
      artoo  = new Robot();     // Default starting position (1,1)
      deetoo = new Robot(2,5);  // Initially at x=2, y=5
      meetoo = new Robot(7,7);  // Initially at x=7, y=7

      System.out.println("Initially artoo  is at " + artoo.getPosition());
      System.out.println("Initially deetoo is at " + deetoo.getPosition());
      System.out.println("Initially meetoo is at " + meetoo.getPosition());
      // Move the Robot named artoo one position North
      artoo.moveNorth();
      // Move the Robot named deetoo one position East and then one position South
      deetoo.moveEast();
      deetoo.moveSouth();
      // Move the Robot named meetoo to the position with x and y coordinates
      // 5 and 3 respectively
      meetoo.moveTo(5,3);
      System.out.println("Now artoo is at  " + artoo.getPosition());
      System.out.println("Now deetoo is at " + deetoo.getPosition());
      System.out.println("Now meetoo is at " + meetoo.getPosition());
   }
}</pre>
<p>The expected output will be:</p>
<pre>
Initially artoo  is at (1, 1)
Initially deetoo is at (2, 5)
Initially meetoo is at (7, 7)
Now artoo is at  (1, 2)
Now deetoo is at (3, 4)
Now meetoo is at (5, 3)</pre>
