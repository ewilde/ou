<h1>Activity 1.4 - Robot world - inheritance, overriding and overloading </h1>

<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>This exercise allows you to test all the various robot classes that inherit
from the simple <span class="PA">Robot</span> class, discussed in the course
text. It also displays the robot movement graphically on a grid. </p>

<h2>Materials </h2>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this exercise contains
six classes: </p>

<ul><li><span class="PA">Robot</span>, which is complete; </li>

<li><span class="PA">MagicRobot</span>, which inherits from <span class="PA">Robot</span>, and is also complete;</li>

<li><span class="PA">SpeedRobot</span>, which inherits from <span class="PA">Robot</span>, and is incomplete;</li>

<li><span class="PA">VariableSpeedRobot</span>, which inherits from <span class="PA">SpeedRobot</span>, and is
also incomplete; </li>

<li><span class="PA">TestRobot</span>, which is complete; </li>

<li><span class="PA">Grid</span>, which is responsible for the graphical display of
the grid containing the various robots. </li>
</ul>

<p>This represents the most complex set of classes we have seen so far. Realistic
large commercial systems may contain hundreds or even thousands of classes. </p>

<h2>Task </h2>

<p>In the test class <span class="PA">TestRobot</span>,
we have provided code to create the various robot objects and to invoke some of
their methods. The program should compile and run already but some kinds of
robots will not behave properly. You are to complete the classes <span class="PA">SpeedRobot</span> and <span class="PA">VariableSpeedRobot</span>. </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>

<ol>
 <li>Complete the code for the four methods of the <span class="PA">SpeedRobot</span> class, <span class="PA">moveNorth, moveSouth, moveEast</span> and <span class="PA">moveWest</span>, which
     override the corresponding methods in the <span class="PA">Robot</span> class.</li>
 <li>Complete the code for the four methods of the <span class="PA">VariableSpeedRobot</span> class, <span class="PA">moveNorth, moveSouth, moveEast</span> and <span class="PA">moveWest</span>, which
     overload the corresponding methods in the <span class="PA">SpeedRobot</span>
     class.</li>
 <li>Build and run the project and check that both
     the text output and graphical output are as you would expect, given the
     statements in the <span class="PA">main</span> method of the <span class="PA">TestRobot</span> class.</li>
</ol>
