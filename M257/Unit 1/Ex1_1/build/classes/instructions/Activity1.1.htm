<h1>Activity 1.1 - Executing some simple assignment statements</h1>

<h2>Topic </h2>

<p>This exercise allows you to write some simple assignment statements as part of
a Java program. </p>

<h2>Materials </h2>

<p>In addition to the Solution document, the project for this exercise contains
one class:</p>

<ul><li><span class="PA">SimpleStatements</span>, which is incomplete.</li></ul>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>The class <span class="PA">SimpleStatements</span>
contains a <span class="PA">main</span> method and there are a number of
declarations of integer variables in this method. You are to assign values to
these variables, and use further assignment statements to carry out arithmetic
calculations involving these variables. After each stage, the program is to
display the current contents of the variables. </p>

<h2>Instructions </h2>

<p>Open the project Ex1_1. In the Projects window expand the project tree and
locate the source file <span class="PA">SimpleStatements.java.</span> Double-click on the file to open the Edit window for the
class. Carry out the following instructions in turn, and at each stage build
and run the program to see the effect.</p>

<ol>
 <li>First run the program without making any
     changes. This should give several compilation errors. Study the message
     carefully and explain what you think is happening here.</li>
 <li>Insert three assignment statements to give
     initial values to the variables <span class="PA">x</span>, <span class="PA">y</span> and <span class="PA">z</span> as indicated by the comments in the source file. Run the program again - it should execute successfully this time. Is the output what you would expect now?</li>
 <li>Add three further assignment statements to
     modify the contents of variables <span class="PA">x</span>, <span class="PA">y</span> and <span class="PA">z</span>, as indicated by the comments in the source file. Insert (or copy and paste from above) <span class="PA">System.out.println</span>
     statements to display the new contents of the three variables. The text of
     the first of these output statements should say &quot;After further
     calculations:&quot; Now work out what output you would expect, then run
     the program again and check that the output is as you expected.</li>
</ol>
