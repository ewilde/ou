<h1>Discussion of Activity 1.1 - Executing some simple assignment statements </h1>

<h2>Sample solutions </h2>

<ol><li><p>You should get three compilation errors indicating that variables <span class="PA">x</span>, <span class="PA"> y</span> and <span class="PA">z</span> <span class="PA">&quot;might not have been initialized&quot;</span> and therefore their values cannot be displayed by the <span class="PA">System.out.println</span> statements.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a situation where Java does not initialize variables to a default value. To correct these errors, you need to explicitly assign an initial value to each variable (as in the next task). </p></li>
    <li>You should have added something like this
<pre>
x = 23;
y = 333;
z = 99;
</pre>
        <p>Note that it is important to use lower case names for <span class="PA">x</span>, <span class="PA">y</span> and <span class="PA">z</span>, as that is how they have been declared (since Java is case-sensitive).</p>
        <p>We could also have carried out declaration and initialization in one statement as follows:</p>
<pre>
int x = 23;
int y = 333;
int z = 99;
</pre>
        <p>The output should be: </p>
<pre>
After initialization:
x contains 23
y contains 333
z contains 99
</pre>
     </li>
      <li>You should have added something like this
<pre>
x = x + 12;
y = y - 100;
z = x * y;
System.out.println(&quot;After further calculations:&quot;);
System.out.println(&quot;x contains &quot; + x );
System.out.println(&quot;y contains &quot; + y );
System.out.println(&quot;z contains &quot; + z );
</pre>
      <p>The output should be: </p>
<pre>
After initialization:
x contains 23
y contains 333
z contains 99
After further calculations:
x contains 35
y contains 233
z contains 8155
</pre>
    </li>
